# Calorie Counter 

<!-- A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach was taken, unsolved problems, user stories, and notes to yourself so you can come back to your project later in the course and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc -->

I made this app with React, HTMl, Javascript and Css. 
The app is deployed on Heroku: [My Calorie Counter](https://www.example.com)

I did a wireframe to decide my layout and where I wanted my inputs as well as the logged data.

The only issues I ran into was getting the daily total to calculate and positioning the grid.
